# Soundcloud Playground

This is an in-progress project to help me get off the ground with the Soundcloud API, formatting the Soundcloud player, and the like. Each exercise will go in its own contained sub-directory so I can keep track of lessons learned in a modular fashion.

#### 001 Initial SC Exploration

Exploring what is out there. Custom JS Soundcloud Player, intro to the API and SDK, setting up SC apps, etc.

#### 002 Javascript SDK intro

A bit more focused intro to using the Javascript SDK to load SC content onto a page: individual tracks, all tracks from a user, the hottest SC track at the time, etc.

#### 003 "Coding for Good" Soundcloud Tutorial
